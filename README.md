# Dice Roller App

A simple Flutter application that simulates rolling a dice. This app demonstrates the basics of Flutter development, including state management, UI design, and random number generation.

## Features

- Roll a virtual dice with a tap of a button.  
- Displays a random number between 1 and 6 on the dice face.  
- Minimalistic and user-friendly interface.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine. [Get Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)  
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Some-arth/Dice-Roller-App`  
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd dice-roller`  
3. Fetch dependencies: `flutter pub get`  
4. Run the app: `flutter run`

## How It Works

1. The app uses Flutter's `Random` class to generate a random number between 1 and 6.  
2. When the roll button is pressed, the app updates the state with the new random number.  
3. The dice face updates dynamically to reflect the rolled number.

## Built With

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - The mobile app development framework.
